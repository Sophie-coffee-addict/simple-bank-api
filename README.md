# ðŸ’¸ Simple Bank Payments API

A mock .NET 6 Web API for simulating bank transfers. 
I built a simple RESTful Web API in ASP.NET Core to simulate banking transactions. 
It includes transfer logic, validation, structured logging, global error handling, Swagger for testing, and containerisation with Docker. I used this project to strengthen my backend fundamentals and understand how to build reliable APIs., and integrated with GitHub Actions for CI.

## Features

- âœ… POST API endpoint to simulate bank transfers
- âœ… Validates sender, receiver, and amount fields
- âœ… Generates unique transaction ID and timestamp
- âœ… Swagger UI
- âœ… Integrated logging with `ILogger<T>` to track request activity
- âœ… Global error handling using `UseExceptionHandler()` middleware with standard JSON response
- âœ… Containerised with Docker
- âœ… CI pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Sample Request

**POST** `/api/transfer`
This endpoint simulates a successful bank transfer.

```json
{
  "fromAccount": "123456789",
  "toAccount": "987654321",
  "amount": 250.75
}
```

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "transactionId": "a8a4d483-c3a6-46b3-922f-bb52cdfdc863",
  "status": "Success",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-03T05:20:37.0781199Z"
}
```

## Logging Output Example
The log includes timestamp, source and target accounts, and transfer amount â€“ useful for debugging and auditing.

## Error Handling Example
Implement global exception handling using UseExceptionHandler middleware

- Captures unhandled exceptions across the app
- Logs error details using ILogger<Program>
- Returns consistent JSON error response with HTTP 500

## Swagger UI Test Example

1. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:<your-port>/swagger

## Run Locally

```bash
dotnet run
```

Access via:
https://localhost:<your-port>/api/transfer

## Run with Docker

docker build -t simple-bank-api .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 simple-bank-api

Then POST to:
http://localhost:8080/api/transfer

## RESTful API Design Principles

This project follows RESTful API design principles, ensuring a clean, resource-oriented, and predictable interface. Key aspects include:

âœ… Resource-based URL design: Endpoints are structured around logical resources, such as /api/transfer.

âœ… Use of HTTP methods to express intent: The API uses POST to create new transfer records, and can be extended with GET, PUT, or DELETE for full CRUD operations.

âœ… Stateless communication: Each request contains all necessary information, with no reliance on server-side session state.

âœ… JSON-formatted data: Both requests and responses use structured, readable JSON payloads.

âœ… Standardised responses: On success or failure, responses are consistent, and error handling is centralised using middleware.

âœ… Scalable architecture: The application is containerised with Docker and includes logging and exception handling, making it robust and production-ready.

This approach makes the API intuitive for frontend developers and easy to integrate with external systems.
